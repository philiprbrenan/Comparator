Result =  (Measure AND Stored AND CHANNEL) OR (Â¬Measure AND Channel)
Result =  ((Measure AND Stored) OR Â¬Measure) AND Channel)
Result =  (Â¬Measure OR Stored) AND Channel)

Less than = (Stored and !Measure and Channel)

Then find transition point between less than and not less than to locate point
